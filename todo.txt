- Note setup steps - installing docker, kubenetes cli, ssh key stuff etc (see Jon's presentation if needed)
- Note the creation of an access token in docker hub to use for $ docker login
- Consider this:
Logging in with your password grants your terminal complete access to your account. 
For better security, log in with a limited-privilege personal access token. Learn more at https://docs.docker.com/go/access-tokens/
- Also consider access token permissions (upon creation)
